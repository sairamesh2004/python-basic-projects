# Python Basic Projects

This repository contains a collection of beginner-to-intermediate Python
command-line projects created to strengthen core programming fundamentals.

The goal of these projects is to practice writing clean, structured Python
code before progressing to more advanced topics such as object-oriented
programming, file handling, APIs, and backend frameworks.

## Projects Included

### 1. Bank CLI Application
A menu-driven banking system that allows users to:
- Check account balance
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money with validation

**Concepts practiced:** functions, loops, input validation, state management,
and execution control using `if __name__ == "__main__"`.

---

### 2. Slot Machine Game
A Python command-line slot machine game where users can:
- Place bets
- Spin random symbols
- Win or lose based on matching patterns

**Concepts practiced:** randomness, conditional logic, game loops, and balance
tracking.

---

### 3. Hangman Game
A command-line implementation of the classic Hangman game featuring:
- Random word selection
- ASCII-based hangman display
- Input validation
- Replay support

**Concepts practiced:** functions, sets, dictionaries, nested loops, and
game state management.

---

### 4. Simple Substitution Cipher
A basic character substitution cipher implemented for learning purposes to
demonstrate reversible character mapping.

**Concepts practiced:** list manipulation, indexing, randomization,
and encoding/decoding logic.

> Note: This is **not secure encryption** and is intended only for
> educational purposes.

## Purpose

These projects were built as part of continuous practice to develop a strong
foundation in Python programming before moving on to intermediate and
advanced-level system design.

Each project contains its own README file with additional details and
instructions on how to run it.
