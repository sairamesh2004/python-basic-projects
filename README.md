# Python Basic Projects

This repository contains a collection of beginner-to-intermediate Python
command-line projects built to strengthen core programming fundamentals.

The focus of these projects is on:
- Control flow and loops
- Functions and modular design
- Input validation and error handling
- State management
- Randomness and basic game logic
- Proper execution control using `if __name__ == "__main__"`

## Projects Included

### 1. Bank CLI Application
A menu-driven banking system that allows users to:
- Check account balance
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money with validation

**Concepts used:** functions, loops, global state handling, input validation.

---

### 2. Slot Machine Game
A simple Python slot machine game where users can:
- Place bets
- Spin random symbols
- Win or lose based on matching patterns

**Concepts used:** randomness, game loops, conditional logic, balance tracking.

## Purpose
These projects were created as part of continuous practice to build a strong
foundation in Python programming before moving on to more advanced topics
such as object-oriented design, file persistence, APIs, and backend frameworks.

## Future Improvements
- Refactor projects using OOP principles
- Add file-based persistence
- Improve input validation
- Write unit tests

> Note: These projects are intentionally kept simple and focused on fundamentals.
