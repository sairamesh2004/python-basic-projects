# Simple Substitution Cipher

A basic Python implementation of a character substitution cipher built for
learning purposes.

## Description
This project demonstrates how characters can be mapped and substituted using
a shuffled character set, allowing messages to be encoded and decoded.

## Concepts Practiced
- Lists and indexing
- Character mapping
- Randomization
- Encoding and decoding logic

## Disclaimer
This is **not secure encryption** and is intended only for educational use.

## How To Run
```bash
python simple_substitution_cipher.py
